# Simple React CMS

A simple starting point for custom CMS ReactJS based applications.  This particular example connects to Firebase, but could easily be connected to other backends.  Utilizes Bootstrap v4 and Start Bootstrap - SB Admin v5.0.3

## Motivation

I needed a simple CMS starting point that I could extend to a few different sites. All sites were coded with ReactJS on the frontend and connected to Firebase for the backend. 

### Installation

Simple React CMS requires [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to run.  [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used for the data layer.  Another backend could be swapped in.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd simple-react-cms
$ npm install -d
$ npm start
```

Update src/Compontents/Firebase.js with your Firebase connection settings, if using Firebase.
